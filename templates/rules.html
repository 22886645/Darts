  <div class="card-text">The marking board should be mounted on the wall so that the center circle is 173 cm from the ground. The launch line must be at least 237 cm from the board. The thrower should also not place his foot on the line or in front of the line. The dartboard is placed on the wall in such a way that it is exactly in the center of sight of an 182 cm person. Each player in each set or hand of the game must throw 3 arrows. . The starter of the game is determined by throwing a dart from both players, so that the player who shoots his arrow closer to the center of the target (bull) will start the game. If the arrow lands on one of the parts of the mole or in the middle of the mole, the throw does not count. The beams should also remain on the board and the distance from the beam to the center should be determined. Darts are played in many different models, including 501, the most famous of which, or 301, and many other models.

  	<h3> How does the scoring work</h3> 
    Numbers from 1 to 20 are placed on the dart board and, as mentioned, 62 parts with special points are marked on it. The two red and green rims on the outside and inside of the board are below the numbers and are known as double rims and triple rims. The rules of darts are that if the darts land on one of the double houses, the score will be twice the number placed on top of it, and if the arrow lands on one of the triple houses, the number will be multiplied by 3.

    So, contrary to what most people think, and unlike sports such as archery and archery, Dart Central House does not have the highest score in the game and is ranked fifth in this regard.

<h3>How to throw the Dart</h3>
    There are three ways to stand behind the marked line for throwing darts. These methods are like standing methods for aiming in shooting. There is no set rule for how to stand behind the line, and anyone can stand behind the line as easily as possible, but the best way to stand in which you are more likely to score more points is to stand 45 degrees. In this case, the same foot that the thrower's hand is on should be in front and all the weight of the athlete should fall on it. The other foot is placed on the toe and maintains the player's balance. Keep in mind that the centerline of the dartboard is the best place for a thrower.
